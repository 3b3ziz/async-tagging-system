# Tagging System Viewer

This is a React application that visualizes posts and their automatically generated tags from the tagging system.

## Features

- View posts from the mock data
- See tags generated by OpenAI for each post
- Display metadata about posts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd viewer
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the API server (from project root):
   ```
   npm run viewer:server
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, start the React app:
   ```
   npm run viewer
   ```

4. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Development

This application is built using:
- React
- TypeScript
- Fetch API for data retrieval

The backend API server connects to:
- Neo4j graph database for tag data
- Local JSON file for post data

## Architecture

The application consists of:
1. **React Frontend**: UI for displaying posts and tags
2. **Express API Server**: Backend for serving post and tag data
3. **Neo4j Connection**: For accessing tag relationships

## Complete Workflow

For a complete demonstration:
1. Reset the Neo4j database: `npm run sim:graph:reset`
2. Run the test cycle: `npm run test:cycle`
3. Start the API server: `npm run viewer:server`
4. Start the React app: `npm run viewer`
